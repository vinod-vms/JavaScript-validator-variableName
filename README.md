## JavaScript-validator-variableName
Checks whether the string is a valid identifier or not which you can use in your code.
### Description
This program checks for all allowed English names for a JavaScript identifier (up to 33 characters). Please note that the maximum length of a variable name can be really large. I have restricted it to 33 characters as per JavaScript Best Practices. Also, currently unicode characters are allowed as variable names. This program does not allow any non-English characters.
